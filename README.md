## Introduction

Welcome to MyBlog, a sample project built with React. This project leverages the power of Styled Components for efficient and scalable styling.

## Styled Components in React

Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS styling framework that uses tagged template literals in JavaScript and the power of CSS to provide a platform that allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It removes the mapping between components and styles. This means that when you're defining your styles, you're actually creating a normal React component, that has your styles attached to it.

## Why Styled Components?

1. **Automatic critical CSS**: Styled Components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically.

2. **No class name bugs**: Styled Components generates unique class names for your styles. You never have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings.

3. **Easier deletion of CSS**: it can be hard to know whether a class name is used somewhere in your codebase. Styled Components makes it obvious, as every bit of styling is tied to a specific component.

4. **Simple dynamic styling**: adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.
